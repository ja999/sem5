Use the precompiler to be able to define macros.
And it remembers about semi-colons at the end of the line SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO!
See example for more. To use

> make

you have to have

lpsolve

defined as the LPsolve executable.




All in all, just run 

> precompiler.rb filename

to get filename.lp
